## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset that provides insights into mobile device usage and user behavior patterns. The dataset, contributed by valakhorasani, can be used for various data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Dataset Information

The dataset is available as a CSV file named `user_behavior_dataset.csv` (size: 38.88 kB). You can also access the dataset directly on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset).

## Getting Started with GitHub

If you’re new to GitHub, don’t worry! Follow these instructions to set up your GitHub repository, create branches, and push your changes. If you prefer a graphical interface, you can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

### Setting Up Your Branch

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Create a new branch for your work (replace `your_name` with your actual name or feature):
    ```sh
    git checkout -b your_name
    ```

This branch is where you’ll make changes without affecting the main project files.

### Pushing Your Changes

1. After making changes, add the files to be staged:
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

2. Commit your changes with a message describing what you changed:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
    ```

3. Push your changes to GitHub:
    ```sh
    git push origin your_name
    ```

4. Once your changes are pushed, you can create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub to review and merge them into the main project.

> **Note**: Always create a new branch for each feature or update to keep the main branch clean and organized.
